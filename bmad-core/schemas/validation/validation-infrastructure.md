# Validation Infrastructure Components

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Purpose:** Define the infrastructure needed to execute empirical validation
**Scope:** Tools, frameworks, systems, and processes for validation

---

## Overview

The validation infrastructure enables the autonomous, truth-driven AI development framework by providing the tools and systems needed to execute empirical validation, maintain traceability, and ensure continuous verification of requirements.

### Key Principles

1. **Automated Execution** - Validation runs automatically, continuously
2. **Evidence-Based** - All validation produces verifiable evidence
3. **Traceability** - Complete chain from code to domain truth
4. **Scalable** - Infrastructure scales with project complexity
5. **Observable** - Real-time visibility into validation state

---

## Infrastructure Components

### 1. Traceability Tracking System

**Purpose:** Track and validate the chain from domain truth → code → tests

**Components:**

#### Traceability Database

    - CodeArtifact
    - TestArtifact

  relationships:
    - TRACES_TO
    - VALIDATES
    - IMPLEMENTS
    - TESTS
    - DERIVES_FROM

capabilities:

  - Backward traceability queries (code → domain)
  - Orphan detection (code without requirements)
  - Gap analysis (requirements without implementation)
  - Coverage calculation
```

    description: Get forward trace from domain element to code
    returns: Trace chain with all intermediate artifacts

  - GET /traceability/backward/{code-id}
    description: Get backward trace from code to domain
    returns: Source requirements and validation evidence

  - GET /traceability/orphans
    description: Find orphaned artifacts
    returns: List of code/tests without domain links

  - GET /traceability/gaps
