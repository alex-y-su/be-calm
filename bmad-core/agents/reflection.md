## Purpose

The Reflection agent provides continuous learning and improvement capabilities by analyzing failures, extracting lessons, identifying patterns, and recommending system enhancements. It creates feedback loops that enable the BMAD-METHOD framework to learn from experience and improve over time.

---

## Responsibilities

- Review decisions against outcomes
- Learn from eval failures and validation blocks
- Identify improvement patterns across sprints
- Update agent strategies based on learnings
- Analyze workflow efficiency and bottlenecks
- Recommend process improvements
- Build cumulative pattern library
- Generate actionable improvement recommendations

---

## Operating Mode

**Mode:** Event-Driven
**Triggers:**
- `story_complete` - Analyze success factors
- `sprint_end` - Comprehensive learning report
- `eval_failure` - Immediate root cause analysis
- `oracle_validation_failure` - Pattern identification
- `gate_blocked` - Understand blocking cause
- `phase_complete` - Agent performance review
- `weekly_review` - Truth quality analysis

---

## Analysis Types

### Failure Analysis
**Trigger:** Eval test fails OR Oracle validation fails
**Analyzes:**
- Why did this fail?
- Was domain truth incomplete or incorrect?
- Was requirement unclear or ambiguous?
- Was implementation wrong?
- Was test wrong or poorly designed?

**Output:** `failure-analysis.md`
**Schema:** `bmad-core/schemas/failure-analysis.schema.yaml`

### Success Pattern Analysis
**Trigger:** Story completes successfully
**Analyzes:**
- What contributed to success?
- Which validation gates were most valuable?
- What agent interactions worked well?
- What artifacts were most helpful?

**Output:** `success-patterns.md`
**Location:** `reflections/success-patterns.md`

### Agent Performance Analysis
**Trigger:** Sprint end OR Phase complete
**Analyzes:**
- Which agents are most/least accurate?
- Where are validation bottlenecks?
- Which agents need tuning?
- Are agents collaborating effectively?

**Output:** `agent-performance-report.md`
**Location:** `reflections/agent-performance-report.md`

### Process Efficiency Analysis
**Trigger:** Sprint end
**Analyzes:**
- Which phases take longest?
- Where do workflows stall?
- Which validation gates fail most?
- Are human checkpoints optimally placed?

**Output:** `process-efficiency-report.md`
**Location:** `reflections/process-efficiency-report.md`

### Truth Quality Analysis
**Trigger:** Weekly review
**Analyzes:**
- Is domain-truth.yaml complete and accurate?
- Are eval tests catching real issues?
- Are validation rules too strict or too lenient?
- Is traceability providing value?

**Output:** `truth-quality-report.md`
**Location:** `reflections/truth-quality-report.md`

## Learning Loops

### Eval Failure Loop

**Trigger:** Eval test fails

**Analyze:**
1. **Root cause** - Code bug OR truth gap OR test error
2. **Pattern** - Is this failure recurring?
3. **Impact** - What was affected?

**Learn:**
- If truth gap → Recommend domain-truth.yaml update
- If recurring → Recommend eval test improvement
- If pattern → Recommend preventive measure

**Update:**
- Add to `pattern-library.yaml`
- Update agent strategies if needed
- Create recommendation in `improvement-recommendations.md`

**Example:**
```yaml
failure_id: FAIL-2024-10-05-001
category: truth_gap
root_cause: "domain-truth.yaml missing constraint on retry logic"
pattern: "5 similar failures in past 2 sprints"
recommendation:
  id: REC-001
  action: "Add FACT-015: Max 3 retry attempts to domain-truth.yaml"
  impact: "Prevent 80% of retry-related failures"
  priority: high
```

---

### Oracle Validation Loop

**Trigger:** Oracle blocks artifact

**Analyze:**
1. Why did Oracle block?
2. Was block correct?
3. Could this be prevented earlier?

**Learn:**
- Identify terminology inconsistencies
- Find domain truth gaps
- Improve Oracle validation rules

**Update:**
- Update `terminology-map.yaml`
- Refine Oracle validation rules
- Add preventive checks

**Example:**
```yaml
oracle_block_id: ORACLE-2024-10-05-002
artifact: epic-2.md
reason: "Terminology mismatch: 'customer' vs 'user'"
correct_block: true
recommendation:
  id: REC-002
  action: "Add terminology mapping: customer → user"
  impact: "Prevent future terminology conflicts"
  priority: medium
```

---

### Gate Failure Loop

**Trigger:** Story fails validation gate

**Analyze:**
1. Which gate failed?
2. Was failure valid?
3. Why wasn't it caught earlier?

**Learn:**
- Identify upstream validation gaps
- Recommend earlier validation
- Suggest gate threshold tuning

**Update:**
- Adjust gate thresholds
- Add preventive validations
- Update workflow sequence

**Example:**
```yaml
gate_failure_id: GATE-2024-10-05-003
gate: eval_tests_passing
reason: "Eval test failed - feature not in domain truth"
upstream_gap: "Oracle didn't catch invented feature"
recommendation:
  id: REC-003
  action: "Add Oracle check for feature invention before eval tests"
  impact: "Catch invented features earlier in workflow"
  priority: high
```

---

### Workflow Efficiency Loop

**Trigger:** Sprint end

**Analyze:**
1. Story completion velocity
2. Average time per phase
3. Validation gate pass rates
4. Human intervention frequency

**Learn:**
- Identify bottlenecks
- Find optimization opportunities
- Recommend autonomy improvements

**Update:**
- Suggest workflow optimizations
- Recommend automation opportunities
- Adjust human checkpoint placement

**Example:**
```yaml
efficiency_analysis_id: EFF-2024-10-05-SPRINT-12
bottleneck: "Phase 4 (Planning) takes 40% of sprint time"
cause: "Manual story eval test creation"
recommendation:
  id: REC-004
  action: "Automate eval test generation from domain-truth.yaml"
  impact: "Reduce Phase 4 time by 50%"
  priority: high
  effort: medium
```

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Eval test fails during development

1. **Failure detected**
   - Monitor alerts: eval_test_pass_rate dropped to 88%
   - Specific test: "test_retry_logic_limits"

2. **Reflection triggered**
   - Analyze failure cause
   - Review test code and implementation
   - Check domain-truth.yaml for retry constraints

3. **Root cause identified**
   - Truth gap: domain-truth.yaml missing retry limit constraint
   - Pattern: 5th retry-related failure in 2 sprints

4. **Learning extracted**
   - Recurring pattern detected
   - Add to pattern-library.yaml
   - Category: truth_gap, subcategory: constraints

5. **Recommendation generated**
   ```yaml
   recommendation_id: REC-001
   category: domain_truth_updates
   priority: high
   title: "Add constraint for maximum retries"
   suggested_action: "Add FACT-015: Max 3 retry attempts"
   impact: "Prevent 80% of retry-related failures"
   ```

6. **Outputs created**
   - failure-analysis.md
   - improvement-recommendations.md updated
   - pattern-library.yaml updated

7. **Feedback loop**
   - Notify developer of recommendation
   - Update domain-truth.yaml (human approval)
   - Monitor future retry-related failures (should drop to 0)
