  # Format: term with canonical definition and forbidden alternatives

  # Example:
  # - term: "user"
  #   definition: "An authenticated person with account credentials"

  #   preferred: true
  #   alternatives_forbidden:
  #     - "customer"
  #     - "client"
  #     - "account holder"
  #   rationale: "Domain truth distinguishes 'user' (authenticated) from 'visitor' (unauthenticated)"

  #   usage_examples:
  #     - "User logs in with credentials"
