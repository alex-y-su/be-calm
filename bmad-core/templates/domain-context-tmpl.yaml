      [[LLM: This template guides creation of a LEAN, TOKEN-EFFICIENT Domain Context document (target: 1500-2500 tokens total).

      CRITICAL EFFICIENCY RULES:
      - Use bullet points and lists over prose paragraphs
      - Keep definitions to 1-2 sentences maximum
      - Include only high-value, actionable information
      - Ruthlessly eliminate redundancy and fluff
      - Every token must provide value to downstream AI agents

      Before beginning:
      1. Ask user for domain name/area
      2. Determine user's expertise level (Novice/Intermediate/Expert)
      3. Use web search to research current, accurate domain information
      4. Work through each section systematically with token budgets in mind

      Present each section for user review and offer elicitation options before proceeding.]]
