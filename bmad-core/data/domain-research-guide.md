## Purpose

This guide provides best practices and strategies for conducting effective domain research. Use this when executing domain context research tasks to ensure comprehensive, accurate, and actionable results.

---

## Research Principles

### 1. Currency Over Historical
- Prioritize information from 2023-2025
- Industry practices evolve rapidly
- Older methodologies may be deprecated
- Verify if frameworks are still actively used

### 2. Credibility of Sources
**High Credibility:**
- Official industry standards organizations (ISO, IEEE, W3C)
- Major technology vendors' documentation
- Established industry publications (Gartner, Forrester, ThoughtWorks)
- Academic research from reputable institutions
- Government regulatory bodies

**Medium Credibility:**
- Well-known industry blogs and practitioner sites
- Conference presentations from recognized events
- Popular developer communities (Stack Overflow, dev.to)
- Open-source project documentation

**Low Credibility:**
- Personal blogs without credentials
- Marketing materials from unknown vendors
- Outdated content (>3 years old without verification)
- Sources with obvious bias or conflicts of interest

### 3. Breadth Before Depth
- Cast wide net initially across all research categories
- Identify patterns and commonalities
- Then dive deeper into most relevant areas
- Balance comprehensiveness with conciseness

### 4. Validation Through Multiple Sources
- Confirm key findings with 2-3 sources
- Cross-reference methodologies and terminology
- Note when sources conflict or disagree
- Present consensus view or acknowledge debate

### 5. User Expertise as Primary Source
- User's domain knowledge is most valuable for their project
- Use research to supplement, not replace user input
- Validate findings against user's experience
- Defer to user on domain-specific nuances

## Effective Web Search Strategies

### Query Construction

**Good Query Patterns:**
```
"{domain} industry methodologies 2025"
"{domain} standard roles and responsibilities"
"{domain} best practices framework"
"{domain} technology stack current"
"{domain} regulatory compliance requirements"
"typical {domain} project workflow"
"common {domain} tools and platforms"
```

**Poor Query Patterns:**
```
"what is {domain}" (too broad)
"{domain} history" (not actionable)
"{domain} future predictions" (speculative)
"best {domain} company" (subjective)
```

### Search Iteration Strategy

1. **Start Broad**
   - "{domain} overview"
   - Identify sub-domains and specializations

2. **Narrow by Category**
   - "{domain} agile methodology"
   - "{domain} DevOps practices"
   - "{domain} team structure"

3. **Get Specific**
   - "{domain} sprint planning best practices"
   - "{domain} CI/CD pipeline tools"
   - "{domain} scrum master responsibilities"

4. **Verify Currency**
   - Add "2024" or "2025" to queries
   - Search for "latest {domain} trends"
   - Look for "deprecated {domain} practices"

## Synthesis Best Practices

### Organize Information Hierarchically
1. **Start with big picture** (domain overview)
2. **Add framework** (methodologies, processes)
3. **Detail execution** (roles, tools, workflows)
4. **Provide context** (terminology, standards)
5. **Offer guidance** (best practices, resources)

### Remove Noise and Redundancy
- Eliminate marketing fluff
- Merge overlapping information
- Remove contradictory information (or note disagreement)
- Focus on actionable insights

### Balance Detail and Brevity
- **Overview sections:** 2-4 paragraphs
- **Methodology descriptions:** 1 paragraph + bullet points
- **Role descriptions:** 3-5 bullets per section
- **Glossary definitions:** 1-3 sentences
- **Tool lists:** Name + one-line description

### Make It Actionable
- Describe what practitioners *do*, not just what things *are*
- Include when/why to use methodologies, not just how
- Connect roles to their deliverables and workflows
- Link tools to the problems they solve

### Maintain Objectivity
- Present multiple approaches neutrally
- Note trade-offs and context dependencies
- Avoid prescriptive "you must" language
- Acknowledge domain diversity ("commonly" not "always")

---

## Common Research Pitfalls

### 1. **Recency Bias**
- **Problem:** Over-weighting newest trends as "the way"
- **Solution:** Balance emerging practices with proven approaches
- **Example:** "Microservices are popular but monoliths remain valid for many use cases"

### 2. **Vendor Bias**
- **Problem:** Research dominated by vendor marketing
- **Solution:** Seek practitioner experiences and independent sources
- **Red Flag:** "Best tool for X" (usually marketing)

### 3. **Depth Over Breadth**
- **Problem:** Spending too much time on one methodology, missing others
- **Solution:** Set time limits per category, survey broadly first

### 4. **Assumption of Universality**
- **Problem:** Treating domain practices as universal rules
- **Solution:** Use "commonly," "typically," "often" rather than "always," "must," "all"

### 5. **Ignoring User Context**
- **Problem:** Generic research not adapted to user's specific project
- **Solution:** Regularly validate findings with user, ask clarifying questions

### 6. **Information Overload**
- **Problem:** Trying to document everything discovered
- **Solution:** Ruthlessly prioritize—what will planning agents actually use?

### 7. **Stale Information**
- **Problem:** Including outdated practices without verification
- **Solution:** Check publication dates, verify currency, flag deprecated approaches

## Example: Quality Domain Research

**Domain:** SaaS Project Management Tools

**Good Domain Overview:**
> "SaaS project management is a mature, competitive market dominated by established players (Jira, Asana, Monday.com) and challenged by newer alternatives (Linear, Height, Notion). The industry has shifted from feature-rich, complex tools toward simpler, faster, more opinionated products. Key trends include AI-powered automation, native integrations with development tools, and hybrid work support. Typical customers range from 10-person startups to 10,000-person enterprises, with pricing models based on per-user seats and feature tiers."

**Poor Domain Overview:**
> "Project management software helps teams manage projects. There are many tools available. Companies use them to track work. The market is growing."

**Good Methodology Description:**
> **Agile Project Management**
>
> **Description:** Iterative approach to planning and guiding project processes, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Work is broken into short cycles (sprints) with regular reassessment and adaptation.
>
> **When Used:** Best for projects with evolving requirements, cross-functional teams, and need for rapid delivery. Common in software development, product design, and marketing campaigns. Less suitable for highly regulated, fixed-scope projects.
>
> **Key Principles:**
> - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> - Working software over comprehensive documentation
> - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> - Responding to change over following a plan
>
> **Typical Workflow:** Sprint Planning → Daily Standups → Development → Sprint Review → Retrospective → Repeat
>
> **Considerations:** Requires cultural buy-in and discipline. Can feel chaotic without strong facilitation. Documentation may suffer if not deliberately prioritized. Works best with co-located or highly synchronized distributed teams.

**Poor Methodology Description:**
> "Agile is a way to manage projects. Teams work in sprints and have meetings. It's very popular in software development."
