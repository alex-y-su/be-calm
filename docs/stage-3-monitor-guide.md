# Monitor Agent User Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Stage:** 3 (Monitoring & Reflection)
**Agent:** Monitor üìä

---

## Overview

The Monitor agent provides continuous oversight of your project's health, detecting drift from source of truth, tracking quality metrics, monitoring performance baselines, and alerting when thresholds are violated.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Monitor

```bash
# Monitor runs automatically, but you can trigger manually
bmad monitor measure-health
```

### 2. Check Health Dashboard

```bash
# View current health
cat baselines/health-dashboard.yaml
```

### 3. Review Active Alerts

```bash
# Check for drift alerts
cat baselines/drift-alerts.yaml
```

---

## Core Functions

### Track Drift

**When:** Continuous (file save, commit, validation gate)
**Purpose:** Detect deviation from source of truth

```bash
bmad monitor track-drift
```

**What it monitors:**
- Semantic drift from domain-truth.yaml
- Requirement drift from PRD
- Architecture drift from architecture.md
- Test drift (eval coverage)

**Alerts:**
- üö® Critical: Blocks commit
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Notifies developer
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info: Logs for review

---

## Understanding Alerts

### Critical Alerts üö®

**Block workflow until resolved**

- Eval test pass rate < 90%
- Test coverage < 90%

**Action:** Fix immediately before proceeding

### Warning Alerts ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Recommend action, not blocking**

- Domain alignment < 85
- Performance degradation > 10%
- Requirement drift detected

**Action:** Address soon, log for review

### Info Alerts ‚ÑπÔ∏è

**Track trends, informational**

- Oracle success rate < 95%
- Agent performance declining

**Action:** Monitor, no immediate action

---

## Drift Detection

### Semantic Drift

**What:** Code diverging from domain truth

**Example:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Semantic Drift Detected
Domain Truth: "User authentication requires email verification"
Implementation: Using phone verification instead
Alignment Score: 78 (threshold: 85)

Action: Review src/auth/login.js against FACT-007
```

### Requirement Drift

**What:** Code implementing features not in PRD

**Example:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Requirement Drift Detected
Feature: Admin dashboard analytics
Location: src/admin/analytics.js:45
PRD Reference: None

Action: Add to PRD or remove from code
```

### Architecture Drift

**What:** Components not in architecture.md

**Example:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Architecture Drift Detected
New Component: CacheManager
Location: src/services/cache.js
Dependencies: Redis, MemoryStore

Action: Update architecture.md
```

### Test Drift

**What:** Eval test coverage declining

**Example:**
```
üö® Test Drift Critical
Eval Coverage: 87% (was 93%)
Drop: -6%
Uncovered Facts: FACT-012, FACT-018

Action: Add eval tests for uncovered facts
```

## Health Dashboard

### Overall Health Score

**90-100:** ‚úÖ Healthy
**70-89:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
**< 70:** üö® Critical

**Weighted Calculation:**
```
Score = (
  Truth_Alignment √ó 0.30 +
  Code_Quality √ó 0.20 +
  Performance √ó 0.20 +
  Validation_Health √ó 0.20 +
  Agent_Performance √ó 0.10
)
```

### Reading the Dashboard

```yaml
overall_health:
  status: "healthy"     # ‚úÖ
  score: 87            # Good
  summary: "System health is good with minor warnings"

truth_alignment:
  domain_truth_alignment_score:
    value: 87           # Current
    threshold: 85       # Minimum acceptable
    status: "ok"        # ‚úÖ Above threshold
    trend: "stable"     # ‚Üí No change

alerts:
  critical: []          # None - good!
  warning:
    - "Test coverage low in auth module (68%)"
  info: []

trends:
  overall_health_trend: "stable"
  metrics_improving:
    - "requirements_traceability: +2.5%"
  metrics_degrading: []
```

## Common Workflows

### Weekly Health Review

```bash
# 1. Generate health report
bmad monitor measure-health

# 2. Review dashboard
cat baselines/health-dashboard.yaml

# 3. Check alerts
cat baselines/drift-alerts.yaml

# 4. Review trends
bmad monitor analyze-trends

# 5. Address warnings
# Fix any warning-level alerts
```

### Pre-Commit Check

```bash
# 1. Track drift
bmad monitor track-drift

# 2. Check for blocks
# If critical alerts ‚Üí Fix before committing

# 3. Commit if clear
git commit -m "Feature implementation"
```

### Sprint End Health Check

```bash
# 1. Full health assessment
bmad monitor measure-health

# 2. Analyze sprint trends
bmad monitor analyze-trends

# 3. Generate report
# Review health-dashboard.yaml

# 4. Send to Reflection
# Reflection analyzes for improvements
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Review health weekly** - Check dashboard every sprint
2. **Address warnings promptly** - Don't let them accumulate
3. **Monitor trends** - Watch for degrading metrics
4. **Update baselines** - After major architecture changes
5. **Tune thresholds** - Adjust based on project needs
6. **Act on critical alerts** - Fix immediately
7. **Integrate with CI/CD** - Automate monitoring

---

## Troubleshooting

### High False Positive Rate

**Problem:** Too many false alerts

**Solution:**
- Review thresholds in `core-config.yaml`
- Tune sensitivity based on project
- Work with Reflection to optimize

### Missing Baselines

**Problem:** "No baseline found" errors

**Solution:**
```bash
bmad monitor create-baseline architecture
bmad monitor create-baseline performance
bmad monitor create-baseline quality
```

### Drift Not Detected

**Problem:** Known drift not alerting

**Solution:**
- Check threshold configuration
- Verify domain-truth.yaml up to date
- Review embedding generation

---

## Configuration

Edit `bmad-core/core-config.yaml`:

```yaml
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  continuous_mode: true

  thresholds:
    domain_truth_alignment: 85
    eval_test_pass_rate: 90
    test_coverage: 70
    performance_degradation: 10
    oracle_validation_success: 95

  alerts:
    enabled: true
    block_on_critical: true

  baselines:
    auto_create: true
    update_on_phase_complete: true
```
