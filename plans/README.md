# Truth-Driven Autonomous AI Development - Implementation Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Status:** Planning Complete

---

## Overview

This directory contains the complete implementation plan for transforming BMAD-METHOD into an autonomous, truth-driven AI development framework. The plan is split into 7 documents (overview + 6 stages) to ensure each stage fits within AI coding session context limits.

---

## Core Innovation

**Establish empirical, verifiable truth early** (via test datasets) that serves as the immutable source of truth throughout development, enabling AI agents to operate autonomously while remaining reliable and grounded.

### Key Principle
**Empirical Validation Over Document Trust** - AI trusts executable tests and validated facts, not just written documents which can be wrong, incomplete, or drift from reality.

## Dependencies Between Stages

```
Stage 0 (Prerequisites)
    ↓
Stage 1 (Truth Infrastructure) ← Must complete first
    ↓
Stage 2 (Validation Workflows) ← Requires Stage 1
    ↓
Stage 3 (Monitoring) ← Requires Stage 1 & 2
    ↓
Stage 4 (Orchestration) ← Requires Stage 1, 2, 3
    ↓
Stage 5 (Intelligence) ← Requires all previous stages
    ↓
Stage 6 (Configuration) ← Final stage, wraps everything
```

**Note:** Stages 3 and 4 can partially overlap (Monitor can start while Reflection is in progress)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Approach

1. **Complete Stage 1 First** (Truth infrastructure is foundation)
   - Nothing else works without Oracle, Eval, Validator
   - All schemas must be defined

2. **Stage 2 Next** (Enable basic workflows)
   - Validate truth infrastructure with real workflows
   - Test greenfield + brownfield paths

3. **Pilot Projects** (Validate Stages 1 + 2)
   - Run greenfield pilot
   - Run brownfield pilot
   - Gather learnings, iterate

4. **Stages 3 + 4 in Parallel** (Add autonomy)
   - Monitor can be built independently
   - Orchestration builds on Stages 1-2

5. **Stage 5 Last** (Advanced features)
   - Requires fully operational autonomous system
   - Can be iterative (release features progressively)

6. **Stage 6 Throughout** (Configuration as needed)
   - Build configuration as features complete
   - Metrics dashboards as data becomes available
   - Documentation continuous

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **Oracle accuracy** - If domain-truth wrong, everything fails
   - Mitigation: Human checkpoint after domain research
   - Mitigation: Reflection reviews Oracle decisions

2. **Eval test maintenance** - Too many tests → burden
   - Mitigation: Generate from single source (domain-truth)
   - Mitigation: Auto-update on truth changes

3. **Performance** - Too many agents → slow
   - Mitigation: Resource limits and throttling
   - Mitigation: Priority queue and scheduling

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **User adoption** - System too complex
   - Mitigation: Conservative defaults
   - Mitigation: Excellent documentation
   - Mitigation: Progressive disclosure

2. **Breaking changes** - Existing users disrupted
   - Mitigation: Backward compatibility mode
   - Mitigation: Migration tooling

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this plan** with stakeholders
2. **Begin Stage 1 implementation** (Truth Infrastructure)
3. **Setup pilot projects** (greenfield + brownfield)
4. **Create development environment**
5. **Establish success metrics baseline**

## Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Deployment Model:** Cloud SaaS vs self-hosted vs both?
2. **ML Models:** Train custom models or use heuristics only?
3. **Pricing:** Open source? Freemium? Enterprise?
4. **Platform Support:** VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code, all IDEs?
5. **Beta Program:** When to invite external beta testers?

## Conclusion

This comprehensive 6-stage plan transforms BMAD-METHOD from a manual, document-based system into an intelligent, autonomous AI development framework. The modular approach ensures each stage can be implemented within AI coding session context limits while building progressively toward the full vision.

**Key Result:** AI agents can develop AND enhance software with minimal human intervention while maintaining high reliability through empirical validation in both greenfield and brownfield contexts.
