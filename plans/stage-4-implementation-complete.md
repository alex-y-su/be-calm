const sm = new StateMachine();
await sm.initialize('greenfield');

const de = new DecisionEngine();
await de.initialize();

const orchestrator = new Orchestrator(sm, de);
await orchestrator.initialize();

const collab = new CollaborationFramework();
await collab.initialize();

const bg = new BackgroundExecutor();
await bg.initialize();

// Run autonomous workflow
sm.on('transition', async ({ to }) => {
  const state = sm.getCurrentState();

  // Initialize agents for new state
  await collab.executeWithDependencies(state.agents, 'initialize');
});

// Start workflow
console.log('Starting autonomous BMAD workflow...');
