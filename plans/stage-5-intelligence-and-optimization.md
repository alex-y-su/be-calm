## Intelligent Agent Routing

### Smart Router System

```yaml
intelligent_routing:
  description: "Context-aware agent selection and invocation"

  routing_engine:
    capabilities:
      - Analyze user intent from natural language
      - Select optimal agent(s) for task
      - Predict agent collaboration needs
      - Route based on project context
      - Learn from routing effectiveness

  routing_strategies:
    intent_based:
      description: "Route based on parsed user intent"
      examples:
        - "Create PRD" → PM agent
        - "Validate architecture" → Oracle + Validator + Eval
        - "Fix bug in auth" → Dev + Eval (with context: auth service)

      implementation:
        - Parse user input
        - Extract intent (create, validate, fix, analyze)
        - Extract entities (PRD, architecture, bug, auth)
        - Match to agent capabilities
        - Invoke relevant agent(s)

    context_based:
      description: "Route based on current workflow state"
      examples:
        - In domain_research phase → Domain Researcher + Oracle
        - In development phase → Dev + Eval + Oracle + Validator
        - After eval failure → Reflection + Dev

      implementation:
        - Check current workflow state
        - Identify active phase
        - Select agents for phase
        - Consider phase-specific needs

    pattern_based:
      description: "Route based on recognized patterns"
      examples:
        - Pattern: "Eval test failing repeatedly"
          → Reflection (analyze) + Oracle (check truth) + Dev (fix)

        - Pattern: "Oracle blocking consistently"
          → Reflection (find pattern) + PM (clarify requirements)

      implementation:
        - Monitor agent interaction patterns
        - Detect recurring scenarios
        - Build pattern library
        - Route based on pattern match

    fuzzy_matching:
      description: "Handle ambiguous or unclear requests"
      examples:
        - "Make it better" → Ask clarifying questions OR suggest agents
        - "Check if this is right" → Oracle + Validator + Eval (comprehensive check)

      implementation:
        - Detect ambiguity
        - Use LLM to interpret intent
        - Suggest agent options
        - Ask clarifying questions if needed

  routing_decision_tree:
    - step: parse_input
      extract: [intent, entities, context, confidence]

    - step: check_context
      analyze: [current_phase, project_type, recent_activity]

    - step: match_agents
      strategy:
        - Primary: Best fit agent(s)
        - Secondary: Supporting agents
        - Background: Monitoring agents

    - step: validate_routing
      check:
        - Are selected agents available?
        - Do agents have required inputs?
        - Are there dependency conflicts?

    - step: execute_routing
      actions:
        - Invoke agents in correct order
        - Setup collaboration mode
        - Configure outputs

  learning_loop:
    collect_data:
      - User request
      - Agents selected
      - Collaboration mode used
      - Task outcome (success/failure)
      - User feedback

    analyze_effectiveness:
      - Did routing achieve goal?
      - Were correct agents selected?
      - Was collaboration mode optimal?
      - How long did task take?

    update_routing_rules:
      - Strengthen successful patterns
      - Weaken failed patterns
      - Add new routing rules
      - Deprecate obsolete rules

  confidence_scoring:
    routing_confidence:
      - intent_clarity: 0.0 - 1.0
      - agent_match_strength: 0.0 - 1.0
      - context_relevance: 0.0 - 1.0
      - historical_success: 0.0 - 1.0

    overall_confidence: "Average of above factors"

    action_by_confidence:
      - if: "confidence >= 0.9"
        then: "Route automatically"

      - if: "0.7 <= confidence < 0.9"
        then: "Suggest routing, allow override"

      - if: "confidence < 0.7"
        then: "Ask user to confirm/clarify"
```

      examples:
        - PM creating PRD → Next: Architect (80% confidence)

      implementation:
        - Analyze workflow patterns
        - Build Markov chain of agent transitions
        - Predict next agent(s)
        - Pre-load agent context

    artifact_prediction:

      examples:
        - "If PM creates PRD, then 95% Architect is next"
        - "If eval test fails 3 times, then Reflection needed"

      advantages: "Fast, explainable, no training needed"

      approach:
        - Use heuristics for common cases (fast)
        - Use ML for complex/novel cases (accurate)
        - Heuristics provide fallback if ML uncertain
