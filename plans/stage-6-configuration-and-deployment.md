## Conclusion

Stage 6 completes the Truth-Driven Autonomous AI Development framework, providing users with:

1. **Full Control:** Autonomy levels from conservative to full_auto
2. **Visibility:** Comprehensive metrics and dashboards
3. **Safety:** Risk mitigation and emergency controls
4. **Flexibility:** Multiple deployment options
5. **Reliability:** Production-ready with health checks and monitoring

The system is now ready for production use, enabling AI agents to autonomously develop software while maintaining reliability through empirical validation and user control.
